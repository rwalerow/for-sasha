<details>

<summary>Conclusions with extended resources</summary>

<br>

Calvinism holds to (Bible +) [TULIP](https://www.learnreligions.com/five-point-calvinism-700356) <- link

Reformed holds to something more, seems like they might hold mostly to(Bible +): 

- [The 1689 baptist confession of faith](https://www.the1689confession.com/) 
- Or the older version: [Westminster Confession of Faith – 1646](https://www.freepresbyterian.org/wcf/)

Here is a fulls list of differences between the 2
[1689 vs 1646](https://www.proginosko.com/docs/wcf_lbcf.html)

Notes:

- Calvinism is something smaller(at least it seam to subscribe to less doctrine) than Reformed Baptists(Both confessions seem to contain full TULIP + more)
